Exploring microbiome analysis tools in R

I've been thinking about the intersection of metabolism and microbiome for a while now, and finally had a reason to jump in. But tbh, I don't know that much about microbiology. I do know that microbiome research blew up within the last decade, I think due to advances in sequencing and annotation. And in that time there's been a ton of studies looking at the role of the microbiome on health and wellness. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of gut microbiota and metabolism. 

One big finding I came across is the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by specific gut bacteria and its influence over regulatory T cells. Here's a [great review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5541232/) 

Another is the impact of diet on microbiota composition, suggesting that what you eat influences your internal ecology. [Early article in the field](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/33/14691?utm_source=Master+Newsletter+Mailing+List&utm_campaign=dff4f73044-Monday_email_geography1_25_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b8c28de774-dff4f73044-&mc_cid=dff4f73044&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D)

I think there is a lot to be explored within this field, especially if I can leverage my background in metabolomics. So I'm taking this opportunity to familiarize myself with what tools and datasets are currently out there, and see if I can find something new and potentially interesting.
